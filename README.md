# Penny Project Visualizer

This project uses a population of over 700 pennies and preforms simple random samples on penny years to showcase how increasing the number of trials in a sample decreases the standard deviation. Running the program will prompt the user to imput a sample size and number of trials. After, a plot.png image will be produced with histogram showing the distribution.
